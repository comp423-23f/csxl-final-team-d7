# 0. Group Reservation Design Document // Team D7

Overview: When working on a group project for any of your classes, it can be a hassle to have to make every single person on the team reserve their own seat. This can also be an issue where you might not be able to get the seat that you want next to your team in the lab. However, the main aspect of this feature is to allow only one member from your team to be able to make a group reservation so that when an ambassador checks you in to the system, all of the members on the team will appear on the confirmation page. Additionally, the entire team can sit together without having to worry about losing their seat among their team during the reservation process.

Key Personas: As Sadiya Student, I would like to be able to have the ability of adding my team memebrs to a drop-in reservation's confirmation page so my other team members do not have to redundantly spend their time reserving a spot. Instead, I can carry out the reservation for the whole team myself. Ali Ambassador should have the capability through her service to check us all in as a group. Also, I need to be able to make sure that there are enough seats for a specific seat type within the lab to put in the group reservation and if there is not enough space, I should be declined access to make a reservation for the entire group. Mariam Manager should be able to see all the registered students.

STORIES:
Sadiya Student should be able to check in her friends when she is also checking in, once she is done there will be a group ID that is returned.

Sadiya Student should be able to check her self in along with selecting the amount of group members she wants to check in with her.

Ali Ambassador should be able to see under the check-in users a list of checked-in students registered with Sally Student.

Mariam Manager should be able to see all registered students.

If Sadiya Student's friend is not registered, an error shows up during check-in, taking her to the registration page allowing her to register her friend.
